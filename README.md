The analysis of musical popularity, at the intersection of data science and musicology, has experienced a significant boom, due to the growing importance and collection of digital data and the evolution of machine learning techniques. This research is at the forefront of this emerging field, exploring how the acoustic properties of songs and extramusical variables contribute to commercial success. The goal is to develop a robust predictive model that not only anticipates the popularity of a song based on its technical characteristics and factors such as the artist's follower base or the timing of its release, but also integrates an innovative clustering approach to add an additional dimension to the predictions.

In the theoretical framework of this study, we will review the state of the art in predicting musical popularity, beginning with traditional methods that have focused on direct correlations between playback frequency and individual track features. We will move towards more sophisticated approaches that consider econometric models and artificial intelligence algorithms, recognizing technical limits that currently, with the amount of data available and the computing power at my disposal, cannot be addressed, but still, the research work will reach beyond conventional methodologies. Neural network models, for example, have proven effective in capturing the complex nonlinear relationships between track features and their reception by the audience in numerous previous studies (Lee, J., & Lee, J.-S. 2015).

Specifically, we will focus on how clustering analysis has been underutilized in the musical context and how, by incorporating it, we can reveal hidden patterns in listener preferences and in song qualities that lead to success. Hierarchical clustering, for example, offers a detailed perspective of data structure, allowing the identification of natural groups within the musical repertoire that will be crucial for customizing recommendations and optimizing musical marketing.

In addition to methodological advancements, this work is also distinguished by its comprehensive analytical approach. By including variables such as the number of followers on the music streaming platform ‘Spotify’ and the time from the single's release to the day the DataSet was formed (December 1, 2023), a layer of depth is added to the understanding of popularity dynamics that goes beyond the intrinsic qualities of music. This multifaceted approach is novel and offers a more complete and accurate model than previous studies that have focused on more limited dimensions.

The originality of this research also lies in the practical application of its findings. By introducing the clustering variable into the predictive model, we open up new possibilities for streaming platform recommendation algorithms and for the management of musical content. These techniques can not only improve the user experience but also offer strategies to anticipate the success of songs before their release, which could significantly transform release tactics as well as the promotion of singles in the musical field.

The development of this work will include a critical analysis of the challenges and limitations inherent in prediction in the musical field considering the different predictive and classification models studied, the variability of consumer tastes depending on the region, and the influence of cultural and social factors that may be difficult to quantify.

In summary, this study not only represents a significant advancement in the analytical understanding of music and its popularity but also establishes a solid foundation for future research that could expand our ability to foresee trends and, ultimately, influence the music market.
